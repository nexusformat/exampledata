# Nxdl exampledata

The intention of _**nxdl_to_hdf5.py**_ is to create hdf5 files from the nxdl.xml 
files, currently only `applications` and some `contributed_definitions` are 
supported as the code depends on the existance of an **NXentry** in the definition.

After several iterations the final approach taken with the task was to walk the XML file and build
a master dictionary separated into the different XML tags (group, field, link, attribute etc) then
create the file with this dict in a controlled order, this made it much easier to debug and section off where errors
were during the process.  

The result of executing **nxdl_to_hdf5 -d applications** is the following which is true for each application definition:

    - Hdf5 file is created in **exampledata/autogenerated_examples/nxdl/applications** 
    - A python script to create the definition using h5py is created in **exampledata/autogenerated_examples/nxdl/h5py**
    - A python script to create the definition using nexusformat is created in **exampledata/autogenerated_examples/nxdl/nexusformat**

**Dependancies**
    
nxdl_to_hdf5 requires the following modules:
    
    - pathlib
    - pkg_resources
    - h5py
    - glob
    - lxml
    - bs4
    - tinydb

**Arguments and Usage:**
```     
>python nxdl_to_hdf5.py --help
    usage: nxdl_to_hdf5.py [-h] [-f FILE | -d DIRECTORY]
                       [-s [SYMBOLS [SYMBOLS ...]]] [--nxdefdir NXDEFDIR] [-r]

    This is a script to generate hdf5 files from nxdl.xml definitions

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -f FILE, --file FILE  The definition file to generate. ex: python
                            nxdl_to_hdf5.py --f NXstxm
      -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
                            generate all definitions in this directory one of
                            either ['applications', 'contributed_definitions'],
                            ex: applications
      -s [SYMBOLS [SYMBOLS ...]], --symbols [SYMBOLS [SYMBOLS ...]]
                            pass comma delimited set of key value pairs for each
                            desired symbol ex: python nxdl_to_hdf5.py --f NXstxm
                            --s numP=24, numE=1, numY=10, numX=10
      --nxdefdir NXDEFDIR   Specify an alternative location to the NXDL
                            definitions base directory (where nexpy is installed)
      -r, --report          Report on the Symbols that this definition uses
```


    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**-f  FILENAME**  To generate a single definition file pass the name of it.
   ```
    >python nxdl_to_hdf5.py -f NXiqproc
   ```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**-d DIRECTORY**  To generate all the definitions in one of the applications or contributed_definitions
        pass the name.
   ```
    >python nxdl_to_hdf5.py -d applications
   ```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**-s [SYMBOLS [SYMBOLS ...]]**  To define a pass symbols to be used during generation
    If the definition uses symbols inside but does not specify any in a `Symbols` table then each undefined symbol
    will be set to the value 1. If you want to generate a file using certain values for the symbols you can pass them in:
  ```
  >python nxdl_to_hdf5.py -f NXiqproc -s nE=5, nQX=3, nQY=3
    Process this specific definition [NXiqproc]
	Process using the following symbols [['nE=5,', 'nQX=3,', 'nQY=3']]

Processing [C:/controls/test/nexusformat/exampledata\..\definitions\applications\NXiqproc.nxdl.xml]
	exporting: [NXiqproc]
finished exporting to [G:\tst_nexus\exampledata\nxdl\applications\NXiqproc.hdf5]
  ```
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**--nxdefdir NXDEFDIR**  If you want to specify a different location than the standard _nexusformat/definitions_ 
    you can pass it in.
   ```
    >python nxdl_to_hdf5.py -nxdefdir /home/bergr/testing/nexusformat/definitions
   ```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**-r, --report** To report the names the specified definition is using.
  ```
    >python -f NXiqproc -r
    Processing [C:/controls/test/nexusformat/exampledata\..\definitions\applications\NXiqproc.nxdl.xml]
	exporting: [NXiqproc]
	-Symbol Warning: the symbol [nE] is being used but has not been defined in the Symbols table, setting to default value of 1
	-Symbol Warning: the symbol [nQX] is being used but has not been defined in the Symbols table, setting to default value of 1
	-Symbol Warning: the symbol [nQY] is being used but has not been defined in the Symbols table, setting to default value of 1
  ```

[nxdl_to_hdf5_output](nxdl_to_hdf5_output.md) is the output of running nxdl_to_hdf5.py to generate all definitions in `applications`

[nxdl_validate_out](nxdl_validate_out.md) is the output of running **nxvalidate** against each generated file
